# leibniz-text-adventure

This game is giftware and freeware. I do not believe it needs a formal licence. 
If you do use this code, however, you must provide the code free of charge to everyone.

This is a text adventure written in Common LISP. It is about placating and smoothing-over the anger of a very
child-like, and yet.. strangely intelligent classical Rationalist philosopher: Gottfried Leibniz.

A lot of the code is lifted from here:

http://landoflisp.com/source.html

This is the source code from a wonderful educational book about how to read and write Common LISP games. To run this game,
you need some sort of Common LISP compiler or interpreter or what-have-you, and if you'd like some help getting Common LISP
running on your machine, please email me: vidak@riseup.net, because I would love to help you get this game running.

I am having, and have had, a lot of fun writing nonsense for this game, which, in reality, is very simple and only really
meant to take you thirty minutes to complete.
